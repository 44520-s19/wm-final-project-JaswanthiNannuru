##### 3. Pandas - Pnadas is used for manipulating data built on NumPy package
##### 4. Matplotlib - Matplotlab helps to embed plots into applications 
##### 5. Pickle - Pickle is used for scientific computing
##### 6. collections - Collections are containers that are used to store collections of data
##### 7. Numpy - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
##### 8. Pylab - PyLab combines the numerical module numpy with the graphical plotting module pyplot.
### Procedure
##### 1. Web Scraping an IMDb Website https://www.imdb.com by sending lxml requests.
##### 2. Pickling the data.
##### 3. Importing all the analyzed data into pandas
##### 4. Visualizing the results using Matplotlib.
### Conclusion
